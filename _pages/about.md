Hi! I'm Luning Wang from China, and I'm currently a senior student at the Department of Electronic Engineering, Tsinghua University. 

ResearchðŸ“–
------
I joined Nanoscale Integrated Circuits and System Lab, Energy Efficient Computing Group ([NICS-EFC](https://nicsefc.ee.tsinghua.edu.cn/)) in 2022.9. I mainly focused on a project related to object detection in 2022, and I devoted to the quantization algorithms of LLMs in 2023 (exactly after the birth of ChatGPT). Now I've just started my graduation project at NICS Lab, where I would continue to work on the Data-Efficient Quantization-Aware-Training(QAT) methods of LLMs.

InternshipðŸ’»
