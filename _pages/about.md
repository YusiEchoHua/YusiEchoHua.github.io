Hi! I'm Wang Luning from Hebei Province, China. I'm currently an undergraduate student at the Department of Electronics Engineering, Tsinghua University. 

Research
------
I joined Nanoscale Integrated Circuits and System Lab, Energy Efficient Computing Group ([NICS-EFC](https://nicsefc.ee.tsinghua.edu.cn/)) in 2022.9. I mainly focused on a project related to object detection in 2022, and I devoted to the quantization algorithms of LLMs in 2023 (exactly after the birth of ChatGPT). Now I've just started my graduation project at NICS Lab, where I would continue to work on the Data-Efficient Quantization-Aware-Training(QAT) methods of LLMs.

Internship
------
+ I worked as an RA during 2023.7~2023.8 at the Musketeers Foundation Institude of Data Science, HKU. My work mainly focused on the evaluation methods of LLMs.
+ Now I'm working as an intern at ByteDance, Beijing. I'm working on the development of an appeal chatbot for TikTok.

Future Plan
------
I'm planning to study abroad to pursue a master's degreee in the next 1~2 years. My dream schools include UC Berkeley, UChicago, UCLA, UPenn, etc.
